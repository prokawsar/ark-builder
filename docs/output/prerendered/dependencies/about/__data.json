Before founding ARK Builder, Richard was an employee of Hooli. At work he was often an antagonist to the brogrammers. While at Hooli, Richard worked on the ARK Builder algorithm. However, even though Richard created one line of code on the algorithm on a Hooli laptop which would mean that ARK Builder would be property of Hooli, Richard’s contract with Hooli was void due to a clause preventing him from leaving. Richard continued to work on ARK Builder until its demise, but still was involved with ARK Builder projects such as PiperChat and PiperNet until the company would be shut down in 2019.\u003C/p> \u003Ch3 data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1wbwjsx\">Memorable Quotes\u003C/h3> \u003Cblockquote data-svelte-h=\"svelte-jjn84g\">\u003Cp>I’d like for this company to be different than Hooli and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

System Architecture. Networking and Security. No one in this house can touch me on that. But does anyone appreciate that? While you were busy minoring in gender studies and singing acapella at Sarah Lawrence, I was getting root access to NSA servers. I was a click away from starting a second Iranian revolution. I prevent cross site scripting, I monitor for DDoS attacks, emergency database rollbacks, and faulty transaction handlings. The internet, heard of it? Transfers half a petabyte of data a minute, do you have any idea how that happens? All of those YouPorn ones and zeros streaming directly to your shitty little smart phone day after day. Every dipshit who shits his pants if he can’t get the new dubstep Skrillex remix in under 12 seconds. It’s not magic, it’s talent and sweat. People like me ensuring your packets get delivered unsniffed. So what do I do? I make sure that one bad config on one key component doesn’t bankrupt the entire fucking company.
